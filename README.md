Aim is to predict the salary of employee based on the information provided in the dataset.
The dataset consists of 1 million samples. To reduce time consumption, I have trained and tested the models and did prediction using 50,000 samples.
The predicted value I got, matches with the actual target values. The model is performing well. The model may perform much better when trained on complete dataset. I have performed EDA, preprocessing, built different models, visualized feature importance, did hyper parameter tuning of each model and did prediction.
